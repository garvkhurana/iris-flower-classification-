Iris Flower Classification Project
Introduction

This project focuses on the classification of iris flowers into three species (Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor) based on the size of their sepals and petals. We use the famous Iris dataset, which is a multivariate dataset introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the species of iris flowers.
Dataset

The Iris dataset contains 150 instances, each with 4 attributes (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and a class label indicating the iris species. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of our models.
Requirements

Before running the code, ensure you have the following packages installed:

    numpy
    pandas
    matplotlib
    seaborn
    scikit-learn

You can install these packages using pip:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn


Evaluation

We evaluate the models using accuracy scoreA comparison is made to select the best-performing model based on these metrics.
How to Run

To run the project, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. You can run the Jupyter notebooks directly if you have Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook installed:

jupyter notebook Iris_Flower_Classification.ipynb
